I am currently working on optimizing the CPS transformation of Outlet
(for debugging). I wrote a post about this and received good feedback.
Here are things I need to think about or study:

* "A First-Order One-Pass CPS algorithm" - Danvy, 2001 (clojure-tco)
** http://www.brics.dk/RS/01/49/BRICS-RS-01-49.pdf
* "The Essence of Compiling with Continuations" - Amr Sabry
* "Compiling with Continuations, Continued" - Andrew Kennedy
* Minimal thunkification
** http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.158.7919
* Oliver Danvy
** http://t.co/VXIq3msE
* "first cut would be to reduce thunks: if your only loop construct is
  application, only thunk app-inner-k"
* "second, the more efficient transformations you mention in your post
  specifically reduce allocation by creating fewer closures"
